# Software Architecture Document: [PROJECT]

> Date: [DATE] | Status: Draft

## Purpose and Scope

[Summarize the system purpose, primary problem space, and boundary. Avoid meta statements about the document itself.]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: [e.g. TypeScript 5.8 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g. Next.js 15, FastAPI, React, Azure SDKs, or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]<br>
**Storage**: [e.g. PostgreSQL, Azure Cosmos DB, files, or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g. Vitest, pytest, Playwright, or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]<br>
**Target Platform**: [e.g. Linux containers on Azure, iOS 17+, desktop CLI]  
**Project Type**: [single service/web/mobile/platform/library]<br>
**Performance Goals**: [e.g. <250 ms p95 API latency, <2 s page interactive]  
**Constraints**: [e.g. regulated data, offline use, strict budget, vendor constraints]  
**Scale/Scope**: [e.g. 10k MAU, single-tenant pilot, multi-region growth target]

## System Scope and Context

[Describe the system boundary, primary users, external systems, and business or domain context.]

### C4 System Context

```mermaid
C4Context
    title System Context - [PROJECT]
    Person(user, "Primary User", "Interacts with the system")
    System(system, "[PROJECT]", "System under design")
    System_Ext(ext1, "External System", "Important dependency or integration")
    Rel(user, system, "Uses")
    Rel(system, ext1, "Integrates with")
```

### C4 Container View

```mermaid
C4Container
    title Container View - [PROJECT]
    Person(user, "Primary User")
    System_Boundary(system, "[PROJECT]") {
        Container(app, "Application", "[runtime/framework]", "Primary application entry point")
        ContainerDb(db, "Primary Data Store", "[database/storage]", "Persistent storage")
    }
    System_Ext(ext1, "External System", "Dependency or partner system")
    Rel(user, app, "Uses")
    Rel(app, db, "Reads and writes")
    Rel(app, ext1, "Calls")
```

### C4 Component View

[Omit this section if the project is too small to justify internal component boundaries.]

```mermaid
C4Component
    title Component View - [PROJECT]
    Container_Boundary(app, "Application") {
        Component(interface, "API or Interface Layer", "[framework/module]", "Receives requests and orchestrates work")
        Component(domain, "Domain Layer", "[module/package]", "Implements core business rules")
        Component(data, "Data Access Layer", "[module/package]", "Persists and queries data")
    }
    ComponentDb(db, "Primary Data Store", "[database/storage]", "Persistent storage")
    Rel(interface, domain, "Invokes")
    Rel(domain, data, "Uses")
    Rel(data, db, "Reads and writes")
```

## Solution Strategy and Architecture Style

- **Architecture Style**: [e.g. modular monolith, service-oriented, serverless]
- **Source Code Location**: All project source code must reside in the `/src` directory.
- **Why this style fits**: [Brief rationale]
- **Alternatives considered**: [Rejected approaches]

## Key Runtime Flows and Failure Paths

### Primary Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Primary User
    participant App as Application
    participant DB as Primary Data Store
    User->>App: Initiates action
    App->>DB: Read/write data
    DB-->>App: Result
    App-->>User: Response
```

### Failure Paths

- [Failure mode] -> [Expected mitigation, fallback, or recovery behavior]
- [Failure mode] -> [Expected mitigation, fallback, or recovery behavior]

## Deployment and Infrastructure View

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Cloud["Cloud / Hosting ([provider])"]
        Runtime["Runtime Environment<br>[container/service]"]
        Data["Data Services<br>[database/storage]"]
    end
    App["Application<br>[runtime/framework]"] --> DataStore["Primary Data Store<br>[database/storage]"]
    Runtime --> App
    Data --> DataStore
```

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Security

[Authentication, authorization, secrets, trust boundaries, and compliance posture.]

### Reliability

[Availability targets, retry and fallback approach, resilience patterns, recovery expectations.]

### Observability

[Logging, metrics, tracing, alerting, and diagnostics baseline.]

### Data Management

[Data ownership, lifecycle, retention, migration, consistency, and backup expectations.]

### Integration Strategy

[How the system integrates with internal and external services, APIs, or events.]

### Operations

[Operational ownership, environments, release strategy, and support expectations.]
